# Code & Data Analysis — Bitcoin
Generated file: D:\Trực quan hóa dữ liệu\TQH\data\processed\coingecko_bitcoin_market_chart_last365d_1D_analysis.json

## 1) Project code overview
This project contains the following important modules:

- `src/fetch_data.py`: helpers to fetch raw JSON from CoinGecko (market_chart, ohlc). Includes `fetch_market_chart_range_chunked` and `fetch_recent_market_chart`. Saves raw JSON in `data/raw/` and metadata in `data/raw/meta/`.

- `src/process_data.py`: parse raw JSON to pandas DataFrame, detect timestamp unit (ms vs s), resample to OHLC (via `resample_to_ohlc`), and compute features (pct_change, log_return, MA7, MA30, volatility). Exposes `process_and_save` to save a processed Parquet file in `data/processed/`.

- `src/viz.py`: plotting helpers (Plotly and mplfinance). `plot_candlestick_plotly` returns a Plotly Figure.

- `src/dashboard.py`: Streamlit dashboard to inspect processed data, compare files, and export CSV/Parquet/PNG. Uses caching to speed loads.

- `src/generate_analysis.py`: this analysis generator (loads processed parquet and writes analysis JSON + docs).

## 2) Data file analyzed

## 8) Notes and recommendations
- This analysis is computed on the processed OHLC series. If your processed file is daily resampled, the statistics are daily-based.
- For higher-frequency insights (intraday), keep raw OHLC from the `ohlc` endpoint or fetch exchange data.
- Check for survivorship / missing data: some days may be dropped during resample.
- For forecasting or risk models, consider additional features (volume skew, realized vol, ADR, GARCH models).
